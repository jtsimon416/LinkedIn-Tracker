## 🚀 Next Steps: Get It Running

### Step 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select project: `sduufemakisrzuzrghdt`
   - Click: **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

2. **Run the Setup Script**
   - Open file: `database-setup.sql`
   - Copy the **entire contents**
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click **Run** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)

3. **Enable pg_cron**
   - Go to: **Database** > **Extensions**
   - Search: "pg_cron"
   - Click: **Enable**

### Step 2: Update LinkedIn Credentials (2 minutes)

In the SQL Editor, run this for each account:

```sql
UPDATE public.linkedin_accounts
SET
    linkedin_username = 'your_real_email@example.com',
    linkedin_password = 'your_real_password',
    remaining_tokens = 320,
    next_refresh_date = '2025-12-01'
WHERE name = 'Tech Sourcing Account';
```

Repeat for all 3 accounts:
- 'Tech Sourcing Account'
- 'Sales Recruiting Account'
- 'General Recruiting Account'

### Step 3: Create Your Admin User (2 minutes)

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)**
1. Go to: **Authentication** > **Users**
2. Click: **Add User** > **Create new user**
3. Enter: Your email and password
4. After creation, click on the user
5. Scroll to: **User Metadata** > Click **Edit**
6. Add this JSON:
```json
{
  "full_name": "Your Name",
  "is_admin": true
}
```
7. Click: **Save**

**Option B: SQL**
```sql
-- After creating user in dashboard
UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_user_meta_data = '{"is_admin": true, "full_name": "Your Name"}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'your_email@example.com';
```

### Step 4: Create Regular Users (1 minute per user)

Same as above, but use this JSON (no admin):
```json
{
  "full_name": "Recruiter Name"
}
```

Create users for all 5 recruiters.

### Step 5: Run the Application (1 minute)

```bash
cd linkedin-token-tracker
npm install   # If not already done
npm run dev
```

Open: **http://localhost:5173**

### Step 6: Test Real-Time Features (2 minutes)

1. Open the app in **two browser windows**
2. Log in as **different users** in each window
3. In Window 1: **Check in** to an account
4. In Window 2: Verify it shows **"In Use"** instantly
5. In Window 1: **Check out** from the account
6. In Window 2: Verify it becomes **"Available"** instantly

✅ If updates are instant = **Real-time works!**
