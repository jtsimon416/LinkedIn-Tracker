# Usage Logs Page Updates - New Features

## Features Added

### 1. Recruiter Name Filter
**Location**: Usage Logs page - Filter section

**What it does**:
- Adds a new dropdown filter to search logs by specific recruiter
- Works alongside existing Account and Action filters
- Shows all unique recruiter names from the database
- Automatically resets to page 1 when filter is changed

**Usage**:
1. Go to Admin Panel > Usage Logs
2. Find the "Filter by Recruiter" dropdown
3. Select a recruiter name from the list
4. View only logs for that recruiter

---

### 2. Pagination System
**Location**: Usage Logs page - Bottom of the table

**What it does**:
- Displays 20 entries per page (configurable)
- Shows Previous/Next buttons
- Shows page numbers with smart ellipsis (e.g., 1 ... 5 6 7 ... 20)
- Shows total entry count and current range
- Automatically resets to page 1 when any filter changes

**Features**:
- **Entry counter**: "Showing 1 to 20 of 150 entries"
- **Page numbers**: Shows current page highlighted in blue
- **Smart pagination**: Only shows nearby pages + first and last page
- **Previous/Next buttons**: Disabled when at start/end
- **Works with filters**: Pagination updates when filters are applied

**Example**:
```
Showing 21 to 40 of 150 entries

[Previous]  [1] ... [4] [5] [6] ... [20]  [Next]
           (current page is 5 - highlighted in blue)
```

---

### 3. Enhanced Clear Filters
**Updated**: The "Clear Filters" button now also resets:
- Account filter
- Recruiter filter (NEW)
- Action filter
- Current page to 1 (NEW)

---

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [filterRecruiter, setFilterRecruiter] = useState<string>('all');
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
const [itemsPerPage] = useState(20);
const [totalCount, setTotalCount] = useState(0);
```

### Database Query
- Uses Supabase `.range()` for pagination
- Uses `{ count: 'exact' }` to get total count
- Filters are applied before pagination
- Efficient querying - only fetches the current page

### Filter Options
- Fetches unique account names and recruiter names separately
- Limits to 1000 entries for filter population
- Cached on component mount

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Showed all logs (limit 100)
- No recruiter filter
- Hard to find specific entries
- Long scrolling required

### After
- Shows 20 entries at a time
- Can filter by recruiter
- Easy navigation with page numbers
- Shows exactly where you are in the list

---

## Code Changes

### File Modified
- `src/pages/UsageLogs.tsx` - Complete rewrite of pagination and filtering

### Changes Made
1. Added `filterRecruiter` state
2. Added `currentPage`, `itemsPerPage`, `totalCount` states
3. Added separate state for unique accounts/recruiters
4. Modified `fetchLogs()` to use `.range()` for pagination
5. Added recruiter filter dropdown
6. Added pagination controls UI
7. Updated filter change handlers to reset page
8. Updated Clear Filters to reset page and recruiter filter

---

## How Pagination Works

### Flow
1. User opens Usage Logs page
2. Initial fetch loads first 20 entries (page 1)
3. Separate fetch gets unique names for filter dropdowns
4. User can:
   - Click page numbers to jump to specific page
   - Click Previous/Next to navigate sequentially
   - Apply filters (automatically resets to page 1)
   - Change filters (automatically resets to page 1)

### Smart Page Display
Only shows:
- First page (1)
- Last page
- Current page
- One page before current
- One page after current
- Ellipsis (...) for gaps

**Examples**:
- On page 1 of 10: `[1] [2] [3] ... [10]`
- On page 5 of 10: `[1] ... [4] [5] [6] ... [10]`
- On page 10 of 10: `[1] ... [8] [9] [10]`

## Testing the Features

### Test Recruiter Filter
1. Go to Usage Logs page
2. Click "Filter by Recruiter" dropdown
3. Select a recruiter name
4. Verify only logs for that recruiter appear
5. Check that pagination resets to page 1

### Test Pagination
1. Make sure you have at least 21 log entries
2. Go to Usage Logs page
3. Verify you see "Showing 1 to 20 of X entries"
4. Click "Next" button
5. Verify you see "Showing 21 to Y of X entries"
6. Click a page number
7. Verify it jumps to that page
8. Click "Previous" to go back

### Test Combined Filters + Pagination
1. Select Account filter: "Tech Sourcing Account"
2. Select Recruiter filter: "John Doe"
3. Verify pagination shows correct total for filtered results
4. Navigate to page 2
5. Click "Clear Filters"
6. Verify all filters reset and pagination goes back to page 1

---

## Configuration

### Items Per Page
To change the number of items per page, edit:
```typescript
const [itemsPerPage] = useState(20); // Change 20 to desired number
```

Common options: 10, 20, 25, 50, 100

### Filter Limit
To increase the number of entries scanned for filter options:
```typescript
.select('account_name, recruiter_name')
.limit(1000); // Change 1000 to desired limit
```

---

## Database Performance

### Efficient Queries
- Uses Supabase `.range(from, to)` for offset pagination
- Only fetches 20 rows at a time (not all rows)
- Filter options cached on component mount
- No N+1 queries

### Example Query
```sql
-- Without pagination (old):
SELECT * FROM usage_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100;

-- With pagination (new):
SELECT * FROM usage_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0;
-- (for page 1)

SELECT * FROM usage_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20 OFFSET 20;
-- (for page 2)
```

## UI/UX Details

### Filter Section
- 3 filter dropdowns in a row
- "Clear Filters" button on the right
- All filters reset page to 1 when changed
- Filters work together (AND logic)

### Pagination Controls
- Left side: Entry counter ("Showing X to Y of Z entries")
- Right side: Previous/Next + page numbers
- Active page highlighted in blue (`bg-royal-600`)
- Disabled buttons have reduced opacity
- Smooth hover effects on page buttons

### Responsive Design
- Filters wrap on smaller screens
- Pagination controls stack on mobile
- Table scrolls horizontally if needed
